1. **Step 1: Add Headers**
    - Markdown is a lightweight syntax for formatting text on GitHub.
    - Headers are large texts at the beginning of sections, with six sizes available.
    - Example:
        ```md
        # This is an `<h1>` header, the largest
        ## This is an `<h2>` header
        ###### This is an `<h6>` header, the smallest
        ```

2. **Step 2: Add an Image**
    - Adding images in Markdown involves using descriptive text in square brackets and the image URL in parentheses.
    - Example:
        ```md
        ![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
        ```

3. **Step 3: Add a Code Example**
    - Markdown allows you to add code examples that can be rendered differently depending on the language.
    - Example:
        ```md
        ```
        $ git init
        Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
        ```
        ```

4. **Step 4: Make a Task List**
    - Task lists in Markdown create checkboxes to track progress.
    - Example:
        ```md
        - [x] mylist item
        - [x] mulist
        - [ ] thislist
        ```

5. **Step 5: Merge Your Pull Request**
    - Once you've completed your changes, you can merge your pull request.
    - Go to the 'Pull Requests' section, select your pull request, and click on "Merge pull request".

_Organize ideas and collaborate using Markdown, a lightweight language for text formatting._

# Step 1: Add headers

_Welcome to "Communicate using Markdown"! :wave:_

**What is _Markdown_?** Markdown is a [lightweight syntax](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for communicating on GitHub. You can format text to add heading, lists, **bold**, _italics_, tables, and many other stylings. You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

- Comments in [issues](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues), [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), and [discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions)
- Files with the `.md` or `.markdown` extension
- Sharing snippets of text in [Gists](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

**What is a _header_?** A header is a larger bit of text at the beginning of a section. There are six sizes.

### Example

```md
# This is an `<h1>` header, which is the largest
## This is an `<h2>` header
###### This is an `<h6>` header, which is the smallest



# h1 Heading 8-)
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
