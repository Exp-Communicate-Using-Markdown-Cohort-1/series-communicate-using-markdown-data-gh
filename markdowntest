# Step 2: Add an Image
To add an image, you can use the following Markdown code:
```markdown
![Alt Text](URL)


![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)


```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

greet()



# Step 4: Make a Task List
You can create a task list using checkboxes. Here's an example:
```markdown
- [x] Learn Markdown
- [ ] Add an image
- [ ] Add a code example
- [ ] Make a task list
- [ ] Merge your pull request



This Markdown document now includes a single code block that demonstrates adding an image, a code example, and a task list. Feel free to modify it further or let me know if you need more assistance.
